# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a student at Dwarkadas Jivanlal Sanghvi College of Engineering, Mumbai, pursuing Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering.
I have been into app development since first year of Engineering, and have explored the domains of OS and networks. Lately, I have been exploring the domain of Machine learning and Deep learning. Having worked with several teams on various projects, as well as mentoring teams, I have gained quite some experience with team work and management. I am looking forward to learning new things, applying what I have learned and taking on new challenges!

Apart from tech, I take delight in organizing and managing events. I have been the former Co-Events head of the ACM Student Chapter of our college.
Further, I have headed the Computer Department in our college's Interdepartmental Competiton, Trinity, in my second year. I relish playing sports, especially volleyball, badminton and tabble tennis, and would be up for a game any time!
